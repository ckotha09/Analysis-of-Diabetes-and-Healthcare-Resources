# Diabetes Indicators Analysis using Integrated U.S. Public Health Datasets

This project performs an integrated analysis of diabetes-related indicators across the United States using data from:
- CDC’s U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators
- USA Hospitals dataset (Kaggle)
- Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program

## Objective
To understand patterns, trends, and healthcare infrastructure for diabetes by combining and analyzing multiple public health datasets.

## Key Components
- Data retrieval via APIs and local files
- Data merging by state-level identifiers
- Data cleaning, transformation, and pivoting
- Visualizations: heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots
- Composite indicator creation for deeper insight

## File
- `PRVL03-Python Copyя1 - Revised.pdf`: Full analysis report with code explanations, graphs, and results.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- CDC API
- Kaggle API

## Insights
- Hospital and program distributions reveal disparities in access to care.
- Population and disease indicators show regional variation.
- Merged views help policy and planning in public health.
